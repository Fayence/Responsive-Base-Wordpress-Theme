This is a Wordpress Theme that I am working on for DEVELOPERS

It is built around the HTML5 Boilerplate, and hopefully will provide a great starting point for anyone that is looking into understanding HTML5, Responsiveness, and the proper way to do this on WORDPRESS website. 

This theme is totally free, so go ahead and take it, improve it, destroy it, or whatever you feel like doing.  Fork it! :P

Totally uses SASS and Less, unless you don't want to learn the "future of css" ;)

The reason I chose to create a base THEME and NOT a FRAMEWORK, is to avoid any confusion.  Using Frameworks and Child Themes...can sometimes over complicate the entire project.  At least in my personal and professional experience.
